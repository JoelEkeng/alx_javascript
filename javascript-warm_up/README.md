## Why JavaScript Programming is Amazing

JavaScript is a versatile programming language known for its wide range of applications, from building interactive websites to creating server-side applications. Its simplicity and extensive ecosystem make it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

## How to Run a JavaScript Script

To run a JavaScript script, you'll need Node.js installed on your system. Use the `node` command followed by the script filename to execute your code:

```bash
node script.js
```

## How to Create Variables and Constants

In JavaScript, you can create variables using `var`, `const`, or `let`. Constants, defined with `const`, cannot be reassigned after initialization, while `let` and `var` variables can.

```javascript
const constantValue = 42;
let mutableValue = 'Hello, World!';
var legacyVariable = true;
```

## Differences Between var, const, and let

- `var` has function-level scope.
- `const` and `let` have block-level scope.
- `const` cannot be reassigned after initialization.
- `let` allows reassignment within its block scope.

## Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript supports various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, and more. Understanding data types is fundamental for variable manipulation.

## Using if and if...else Statements

Conditional statements like `if` and `if...else` allow you to control the flow of your program based on conditions. Use them for decision-making in your code.

## Comments in JavaScript

Comments are essential for code documentation and readability. Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

## Assigning Values to Variables

You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator `=`. This is crucial for storing and manipulating data in your scripts.

## Using while and for Loops

Loops are used to iterate through data or execute code repeatedly. JavaScript offers `while` and `for` loops for this purpose.

## Using break and continue Statements

The `break` statement exits a loop prematurely, while `continue` skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

## Functions in JavaScript

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. You can define and call functions to organize your code effectively.

## Functions Without Return Statements

Functions in JavaScript that don't explicitly return a value return `undefined` by default. Understand how this behavior affects your code.

## Scope of Variables

Variable scope defines where a variable is accessible in your code. JavaScript has both global and local (block) scope.

## Arithmetic Operators

JavaScript provides various arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` for mathematical calculations.

## Working with Dictionaries

Dictionaries, also known as objects in JavaScript, allow you to store key-value pairs. Learn how to manipulate and access data in dictionaries.

## Importing Files

To include external JavaScript files in your project, use `require` or the newer `import` syntax, depending on your environment.

## Requirements

### General

- **Recommended Editors:** Visual Studio Code
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the [Semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard) coding style (version 14.x.x) with added semicolons. Reference the [AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as well.

### Execution Environment

- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- Ensure that your code is compatible with this environment.

### File Length

- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
